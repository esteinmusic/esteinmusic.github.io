        <div class="bio-section">
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>After spending his early childhood in KwaZulu-Natal, Estein completed most of his schooling in Braamfischerville, a place he likes to call 'The Slums'. This place also inspired his first and debut album called "From the Slums" where most of the songs are about the violence, crime, gangsterism, poverty and little or no opportunities for young talented kids in that area. In 2024, he enrolled at the University of Cape Town, pursuing higher education while balancing a growing artistic career. His academic journey reflects his pursuit of knowledge and self-improvement, aligning with his long-term vision of breaking generational barriers and redefining success.</p>

            <h2>In Memory of Qiniso Nyembe (aka Killer Vibe)</h2>
            <div class="tribute-header">
                <h3>My Brother • My Best Friend • My Twin</h3>
                <p class="dates">2004 - 2023</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Qiniso Nyembe was more than a friend, he was my brother, my twin soul, he was a person I fully connected with and a person who fully understood me. As kids, we went everywhere together and even went to performances together. He passed away in 2023 during our Grade 12 year, and life has never been the same since. His departure created a void that changed everything.</p>
            
            <p>Qiniso was one of my greatest inspirations to start rapping. He began his rap journey before me, and his passion for music, his lyrical talent, and his fearless expression showed me what was possible. He believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. His hit songs like <a href="https://youtu.be/h4oz9f2Iz88?si=pfZsCAl7niIOfVKN" target="_blank" class="song-link">'Fuck depression'</a> (found here) had me crying in my room all night for a whole month when he passed away.</p>
            
            <p>Since losing him, I've struggled with deep depression, pushed people away, battled suicidal thoughts, and spent much time in isolation. But through the darkness, his memory continues to inspire my music. Every verse I write, every song I record, carries a piece of his spirit. I even released a song for him called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2eKwFsBW4uwNXPUihQoTw3?si=834d9a447e9f4d95" target="_blank" class="song-link">'Letter to Killer Vibe'</a> (found here). This is one of the most emotional songs that I have ever written in my life. When I recorded the it, I just couldn't take it, I kept on breaking and tears kept on falling. It was like I was reliving the moment, the moment when I found out that he was dead.</p>
            
            <p>This journey in music is not just for me, it's for Killer Vibe too. He may be gone physically, but his influence lives on through every beat, every rhyme, every story I tell.</p>

        <!-- Music Journey Section -->
        <div class="bio-section">
            <h2>Music Journey</h2>
            <p>Estein began writing and recording music at a young age, but he started taking his craft seriously in Grade 9 (2020), at age 14. His debut track, 
            <a href="https://youtu.be/URVC3Ta0Qps?si=8JxZ6ssyIaFOkoYA" target="_blank" class="song-link">'6ix 2wenty 5ive'</a> (found here), was released that same year and became a foundation for his artistic identity.</p>
            <p>In Grade 11, he transformed the concept '625' into a personal motto meaning 'Triumph In The Face Of Adversity', solidifying his commitment to using music as a vehicle for purpose and transformation.</p>
            <p>In 2022, he made his first big public performance at the Joburg Theatre, where he courageously requested a performance slot from the program director during a live event. Despite initial hesitation and fear, he was eventually granted the opportunity to perform, marking an important milestone in his development as a performer. He performed his song called <a href="https://youtu.be/FLqvv0fcMrE?si=0CoLWTvyz66luazl" target="_blank" class="song-link">'Barely Breathin'</a> (found here), which he released on the same year.</p>
            <p>His first song on streaming platforms was 'Slumpin', which gained traction but was later removed when he chose to re-direct his artistic path toward cleaner content, reflecting his spiritual and personal growth.</p>

        <div class="bio-section">
            <h2>Influences and Sound</h2>
            <p>Estein's musical evolution began with inspiration from leading South African artists such as Nasty C, Riky Rick, and Cassper Nyovest. As his knowledge expanded beyond national borders, he drew influence from global icons Tupac Shakur, Eminem, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar and more, before discovering the artist who would become his greatest creative influence: NF.</p>
            <p>He later resonated deeply with artists like Lil Durk, Lil Tjay and more, whose emotional storytelling and street-driven narratives reflected the realities of the environments he grew up in.</p>
            <p>Today, his artistry merges emotional rap, conscious hip-hop, and love-driven storytelling, with a focus on vulnerability, introspection, and authenticity.</p>

            <p>Estein represents a new generation of independent African artists committed to emotional honesty and social awareness. He represents 'The Slums'. He represents the youngstars from the place he grew up in, in Joburg. He is putting Braamfischerville into the map. His vision is to create music that reflects the struggles of the overlooked while offering hope, spiritual grounding, and ambition.</p>
            <p>His future work aims to blend artistic depth with commercial reach, using music as a platform to elevate personal growth, inspire marginalized communities, and challenge the narratives of where he comes from.</p>
            
            <div class="in-memory">
                <p class="memory-quote">"My goal is not to gain traction, chase money, fame, nor clout. My goal is to put my music out there so people can hear it, especially that one person who might be facing hardships. I want to give hope, build faith and inspire people to keep grinding.
                I write and rap about real people from the slums, real people from the trenches. This is real to me. This is more than just music, it's therapy. It's a place where I can escape the outside world and reality, a place where I find peace and joy. You can take everything from me, but NOT music nor Jesus."</p>
